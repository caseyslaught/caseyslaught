- 👋 Hey there, I’m Casey Slaught
- 👀 I’m interested in full-stack development, cloud-based geospatial analysis, and machine learning
- 📖 I recently finished a master's at Duke University where I built [Smart Carte](https://smartcarte.earth), a web app for preparing cloud-free Sentinel-2 imagery
- 🦍 On the side, I maintain some technologies at [Virunga National Park](https://virunga.org)
- 🛸 I'm also working on [Rasterly](https://rasterly.com), a tool to easily manage and visualize massive aerial imagery
- 🥧 I also enjoy memorizing digits of pi (1760 and counting)
