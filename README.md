- 👋 Hey there, I’m Casey Slaught
- 👀 I’m interested in full-stack development, cloud-based geospatial analysis, and machine learning
- 📖 I just finished a master's degree at Duke University where I built Smart Carte, a web app for preparing Sentinel-2 imagery
- 🦍 On the side, I maintain some technologies at [Virunga National Park](https://virunga.org)
- 🥧 I also enjoy memorizing digits of pi (1760 and counting)
